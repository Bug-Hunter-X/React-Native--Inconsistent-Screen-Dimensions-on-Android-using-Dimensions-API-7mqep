This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The dimensions may be inaccurate, frequently returning 0 or incorrect values, particularly during the initial render or when the app is in the background and comes back to the foreground. This inconsistency can lead to layout issues, where components are positioned incorrectly or are not rendered correctly.

```javascript
import { Dimensions, View } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{ width: width, height: height }}>
      {/* Content */}
    </View>
  );
};
```
